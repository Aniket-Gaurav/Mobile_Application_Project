Android To-Do list

The project is carried in 6th Semester. 

The project is about creating an Android To-Do list app. 

The app will have the following features:

- Add, remove and edit to-dos .

- View and manage your to-dos on a timeline .

- Search and filter to-dos .

There's a new to-do list app in town, and it's called Android To-Do List.

Android To-Do List is a very simple to use app that lets you keep track of your tasks and projects.

You can create a to-do list and add tasks, or use the app's search function to find existing tasks. 

The app allows you to create custom labels for your task lists and find the status. You can create multiple task lists and switch between them using the app's navigation bar.

Android To-Do List provides a clean and simple interface that makes it easy to keep track of your tasks and projects.
